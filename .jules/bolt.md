## 2025-05-27 - Unit Testing Nuxt Composables with useState
**Learning:** Testing Nuxt composables that use `useState` in Vitest requires `mockNuxtImport` from `@nuxt/test-utils/runtime` or careful global stubbing. Standard `vi.stubGlobal('useState', ...)` may be ignored if the composable relies on Nuxt auto-imports which are transpiled to import from `#imports`.
**Action:** Use `mockNuxtImport` to mock `useState` in tests, or ensure the test environment is fully Nuxt-aware.

## 2025-05-27 - Caching Lists in Composables
**Learning:** When implementing caching in composables using `useState`, ensure empty lists are also cached by checking a separate flag (e.g. `fetchedUserId` or `isLoaded`) rather than `data.length > 0`. Otherwise, empty states trigger redundant fetches.
**Action:** Use an explicit "fetched" tracker (boolean or ID) alongside the data.
## 2024-05-22 - Firestore Query Specificity
**Learning:** Fetching broad collections (e.g., all user tasks) and filtering in memory is a major performance anti-pattern in Firestore, leading to excessive read operations and potential bandwidth issues.
**Action:** Always construct specific queries using `where` clauses to fetch only the data needed for the current view. Ensure variable scopes are clean to avoid accidental redeclarations that might mask logic errors.
## 2026-05-15 - Optimization: Firestore Batch Writes for Iterative Updates
**Learning:** Replacing iterative `Promise.all(updates.map(...))` with a single `writeBatch` combined operation dramatically reduces network connections and latency. When implementing batches in TypeScript within Vue setups, beware of closure contexts dropping strict type narrowings, and always chunk operations to respect Firestore's 500 document limit.
**Action:** Use `writeBatch` chunked by 500 when updating large lists instead of parallel `updateDoc` calls.
