## 2025-05-27 - Unit Testing Nuxt Composables with useState
**Learning:** Testing Nuxt composables that use `useState` in Vitest requires `mockNuxtImport` from `@nuxt/test-utils/runtime` or careful global stubbing. Standard `vi.stubGlobal('useState', ...)` may be ignored if the composable relies on Nuxt auto-imports which are transpiled to import from `#imports`.
**Action:** Use `mockNuxtImport` to mock `useState` in tests, or ensure the test environment is fully Nuxt-aware.

## 2025-05-27 - Caching Lists in Composables
**Learning:** When implementing caching in composables using `useState`, ensure empty lists are also cached by checking a separate flag (e.g. `fetchedUserId` or `isLoaded`) rather than `data.length > 0`. Otherwise, empty states trigger redundant fetches.
**Action:** Use an explicit "fetched" tracker (boolean or ID) alongside the data.
## 2024-05-22 - Firestore Query Specificity
**Learning:** Fetching broad collections (e.g., all user tasks) and filtering in memory is a major performance anti-pattern in Firestore, leading to excessive read operations and potential bandwidth issues.
**Action:** Always construct specific queries using `where` clauses to fetch only the data needed for the current view. Ensure variable scopes are clean to avoid accidental redeclarations that might mask logic errors.

## 2026-04-12 - Pre-computing O(N) filters to O(1) Maps in Vue Templates
**Learning:** Repeatedly calling an O(N) array filter function inside a Vue template (e.g., inside a `v-for` loop) causes redundant calculations on every render. Returning a new array reference from a function call in a template can also trigger unnecessary child component re-renders.
**Action:** Use a `computed` property to pre-compute the relationships into a `Map` so that the template function performs an O(1) lookup instead, which also returns a stable array reference if the data hasn't changed.
